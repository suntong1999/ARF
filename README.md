## Contents

The repository consists of the following:

- `src/`: This directory contains three files corresponding to the different steps of the ARF method:
  - `adv_train.py`: Code for adversarial training in the ARF method.
  - `test.py`: Code for performing predictions using the ARF method.
  - `arf.py`: Code for ARF network.

## Usage

To use the ARF method and comparison methods, follow the instructions below:

1. Navigate to the `src/` directory.
2. Run `adv_train.py` to implement adversarial training.
3. Use `test.py` to perform predictions using the ARF method.
